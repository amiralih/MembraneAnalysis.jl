# Example usage of `MembraneAnalysis.jl`

In this tutorial we showcase some of the main functionality of the package by analyzing an atomistic simulations of a membrane containing DOPC lipids and %10 mol fraction cholesterol. `MembraneAnalysis.jl` needs a PDF structure file (here `s.pdb`) and trajectory files of any format supported by `Chemfiles.jl` (here `t1.nc` to `t200.nc`).

## Setting
